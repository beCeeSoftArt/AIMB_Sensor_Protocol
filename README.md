# AIMB_Sensor_Protocol
NMEA like microcontroller communication protocol definition

Here you will find a easy to use solution for communication between different microcontrollers and operating system platforms 
to syncronize them in via simple communication protocol. 

Maybe the AIMB command spezification can be used as upgrade to your existing NMEA Sentence protocol for controlling and measuring 
with IoT.

Examples of using, you will find in the Arduino/Projects folder like the SensorBox project. Which measures data via arduino and sends 
the measurements as AIMB sentence to serial device.
